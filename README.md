# MultiAuth-Login-and-Signup-System-for-Hospital-
In this Repository i have made a multiauth login and signup system for hospital admin panel with authentication and sessions in which we have  different login and signup pages for doctor and receptionist with different sessions using php language. also i have added a contact us and about us page. u can send the mail using contact us page using mail service. all the backend part is done with php language with some good features of authentication and sessions. for frontend i have used html css and javascript  and for databse i have used mysql.
